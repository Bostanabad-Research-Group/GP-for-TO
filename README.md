Code for the paper [Simultaneous and Meshfree Topology Optimization with Physics-informed Gaussian Processes
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03490), where we develop a new class of TO methods based on the framework of Gaussian processes (GPs) whose mean functions are parameterized via deep neural networks. 

## Overview
We place GP priors on all design and state variables to represent them via parameterized continuous functions. These GPs share a deep neural network as their mean function but have as many independent kernels as there are state and design variables. We estimate all the parameters of our model in a single for loop that optimizes a penalized version of the performance metric where the penalty terms correspond to the state equations and design constraints.

## Requirements
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new virtual environment**:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv GP_for_TO
   ```
   Activate the environment:  
   - On Windows:  
     ```bash
     GP_for_TO\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:  
     ```bash
     source GP_for_TO/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   - [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) == 1.12.0 & CUDA >= 11.3:  
     ```bash
     pip install torch==1.12.0 torchvision==0.13.0 torchaudio==0.12.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
     ```
   - [GPyTorch](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch) == 1.7.0:  
     ```bash
     pip install gpytorch==1.7.0
     ```
   - **Dill** == 0.3.5.1:  
     ```bash
     pip install dill==0.3.5.1
     ```
   - **pandas**:  
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```
   - **Matplotlib** == 3.5.3:  
     ```bash
     pip install matplotlib==3.5.3
     ```
   - **Tqdm** >= 4.66.4:  
     ```bash
     pip install tqdm>=4.66.4
     ```

Once these steps are completed, your environment will be ready to use.

## Usage
Once you have downloaded the code from this GitHub repository and installed the required packages, youâ€™re ready to get started. The primary script, main_TO.py, located in the notebook folder, demonstrates the application of our technique to the topology optimization (TO) problems detailed in the paper.
